## Report Overview

The generated HTML report includes multiple sections for a comprehensive view of your codebase.

### Patch-Level Diffs

This section displays the differences between commits in a clear, visual format. Each change is highlighted, making it easy to see what has been added or removed.

### File History

Here, you can track the changes made to individual files. It shows who made the changes and when, providing context for each modification.

### Tree Changes

The tree changes section visualizes the structure of your repository. It shows how files and directories have changed over time, helping you understand the evolution of your project.

### Risk Scoring

Risk scoring evaluates the potential risks in your code. It considers factors like complexity and the number of changes to provide a score that indicates areas needing attention.

### Blame Data

Blame data identifies who is responsible for each line of code. This is useful for accountability and understanding the history of specific changes.

## File History

The file history feature allows you to dive deep into the changes made to each file. You can see:

- The commit history for a specific file.
- Who made each change.
- The exact lines that were modified.

This information is crucial for understanding the evolution of your code and for making informed decisions about future changes.

## Tree Changes

Tree changes provide a visual representation of how your repository has evolved. This section includes:

- A hierarchical view of your files and directories.
- Annotations that indicate when files were added or removed.
- A timeline of changes that allows you to see the growth of your project.

This feature helps you visualize your project structure and understand how it has changed over time.

## Risk Scoring

Risk scoring offers insights into the health of your codebase. It evaluates:

- Code complexity.
- Frequency of changes.
- Areas with high risk based on historical data.

By focusing on high-risk areas, you can prioritize your development efforts and improve code quality.
